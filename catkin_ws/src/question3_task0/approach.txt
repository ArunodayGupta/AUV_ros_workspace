In the turtle controller we are making a publisher and the receiever is turtlesim_node.
In this we are taking the direction from the user in which we want to move the turtle and the distance.
Now depending on the value given by the user we move the turtle and show its coordinates and where it is facing.
This goes on until you terminate the function.
(The coordinates are not working properly i couldn't understand it properly.)
