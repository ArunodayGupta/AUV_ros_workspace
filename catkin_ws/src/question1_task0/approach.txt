I crated a function chat and in that function there is a publisher and a subscriber connected to the same topic.
I am taking the name of the user and the message the user wants to send to the other person.
Then if the name of the user is different then the callback function will print the message sent by the other person in our terminal.
this will continue until we terminate the loop
