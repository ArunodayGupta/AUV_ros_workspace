For the first node we define a function where we create a publisher and it prints a multiple of 2 at frequency of 1Hz.
For the second node we create one publisher and one subscriber the subscriber is connected to the publisher of first node thorugh the chatter.
It also has its publisher which takes the data recieved from first publisher and multiplies it by 10.
For the third and the final node we make a subscriber which is connected to the publisher of the second node through the topic and it add 5 to the value it recieves and prints it as the final value.
